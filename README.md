# Trajectory Modelling
## Objectives
1. Identify hidden clusters of longitudinal mortality risks from gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithm. This algorithm was designed to predict 180-day mortality among outpatients with cancer (Parikh et al. 2019). 
2. Evaluate the association between identified clusters and End-of-Life care patients received.

Package used: _fdapace_ R package. 

## Data preparation 

## FPCA analysis code

## Codes for tables

## Codes for figures
