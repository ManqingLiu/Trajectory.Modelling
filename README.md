# Trajectory Modelling
## Objectives:
1. Identify hidden clusters of longitudinal mortality risks from gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithms (Parikh et al. 2019). This algorithm was designed to predict 180-day mortality among outpatients with cancer. 
2. Evaluate the association between identified clusters and End-of-Life care patients received.

Package used: _fdapace_ R package.
